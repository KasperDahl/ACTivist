Project: “My Climate Change Actions” - ACTivist

So the design is quite bad at the moment, but we have linked up the buttons.

The buttons with sign-in will get you to the home-page. Here the settings-icon will get you to settings, and from here the home-icon will get you to home-page. The challenge icon (middle one) will get you to challenges, where you can press the food or transportation button. There are settings icons and home icons in many of the pages which will get you to home and settings.

Is the route function a correct approach to connect the screens with buttons?

We are also interested in information about how we should change the design so it is responsive for the mobile screen?

Would it be a good idea to set up a navigation bar?

Do you have maybe some tips on how to refactor the code to avoid code repetitions etc?
