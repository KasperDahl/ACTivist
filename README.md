Project: “My Climate Change Actions” - ACTivist

So the design is really bad at the moment, but we have linked up the buttons.

The buttons with sign-in will get you to the home-page. Here the settings-icon will get you to settings, and from here the home-icon will get you to home-page. The challenge icon (middle one) will get you to challenges, where you can press the food or transportation button. There are settings icons and home icons in many of the pages which will get you to home and settings.

We were wondering if the way the link is done is a generally good or bad way?

We are also interested in information about how we should change the design so it is not as big?

We are generally not up-to-date with the best practices of how to design link-up and css files?

Would it be a good idea to set up a navigation bar?

We want to do a Firebase-database for the sign-in - should we use the demo from last time as a template?
